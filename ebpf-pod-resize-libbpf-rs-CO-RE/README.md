# ebpf-pod-resize with libbpf and CO-RE

NOTE: This code is for illustration purposes only. I made the choice of using RUST
for the libbpf 1.0 complie once run everywhere (CO-RE) eBPF version of this demo.
It was a way to try out RUST and see what the hub-bub is all about.
Two things learned:
1. RUST libraries have a lot of rough edges (YES pun intended)
2. This demo code is probably a very good example of how NOT to write RUST code. :)
